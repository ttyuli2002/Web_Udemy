position:

1. static:
    Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow
    does not move the element, top/bottom/left/right grayed out

2. absolute:
    The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned (not static) ancestor element
    If no ancestor element, then position at left upper corner
    - Has "Z-index", shows which one layers on top of which. 
    - default --> z-index: 0;
    - If prefers element in bottom, can do z-index: -1;
    - If use position: absolute, even with no z-index, the element would go on top of the rest elements.

3. fixed:
    The element is positioned relative to the left upper corner browser window
    will not move when scrolling up and down

4. relative:
    The element is positioned relative to its default position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position
