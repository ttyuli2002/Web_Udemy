position:

1. static:
    Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow
    does not move the element, top/bottom/left/right grayed out

2. absolute:
    The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element
    If no ancestor element, then position at left upper corner

3. fixed:
    The element is positioned relative to the browser window
    will not move when scrolling up and down

4. relative:
    The element is positioned relative to its default position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position
